# Logarithmic Volume

Make volume sliders on html player elements adjust the gain logarithmicly.

## Notes

Any sites that already implement a logarithmic volume slider need to be excluded manually.  
You can typically tell if it already implements it if the volume slider only works for the 50-100% range.

Exclude sites per script in your preferred extension settings page.

Known players that already implement it:
* Jellyfin
